/* Create a file called terrain.js, then, do the following. 
Commit and push as often as you like so that we can monitor the progress of your code in the pull request.

Create a constructor function called Tile that can create new tiles. 
This function will take parameters x and y and create an object that has these properties:
x: the value that was passed to the constructor
y: the value that was passed to the constructor
height: a random number between 1 and 3
type: a random word between grass, rocks or water
condition: a random word between burning, normal or frozen

freeze: if the object is burning, then its condition should change to normal. if the object is normal then 
its condition should change to frozen and if it is frozen, its height should increment by 1
burn: if the object is frozen, then it will become normal. if the object is normal, then it should change to burning.

Go thru all the map again, randomly burning and freezing some tiles. Then, re-output the map in the same way again
